# chatgpt_app

Using ChatGPT has always been a hassle for me, as I had to open the browser every time I wanted to use it. So, I am here with an idea to develop a ChatGPT app. Though the process was tough and time-consuming, I found a solution by using the web_view package to integrate the website inside the app.
